For Project 2, you will be working in groups of 3-4 to build a full-stack Rails application.

**Everyone will pitch an idea for Project 2.**

Additional pitches may be allowed based on time. 

After hearing the pitches, you'll have an opportunity to narrow down what you'd be most interested in building.  The teaching team will use these preferences when we pick the projects moving forward and put together the groups.

### Pitch Guidelines

1. Keep it VERY brief (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch" target="_blank">elevator pitch</a>). Your pitch cannot exceed 3 minutes.


2. Answer these questions:
  * What is your idea? 
  * Who is your user? How will your project help your user solve a problem or achieve a goal?
  * What technologies would you use that we haven't gone over (if any)?
  
3. No slides. You may use the whiteboard to draw any visuals you need.
